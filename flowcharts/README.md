# Flowchart – User Registration

This flowchart illustrates the backend logic for user registration:

1. User fills out registration form
2. System validates input
3. System checks if user exists
4. If exists → error returned
5. If not → password is hashed
6. User is saved in DB
7. Confirmation message sent
